Stock Market Price Prediction

This project centers on predicting stock market prices using machine learning techniques, particularly time-series models. It is designed to help you explore historical stock data, build predictive models (for example using LSTM recurrent neural networks), and evaluate their performance.

Features

* Load and preprocess historical stock data (for example, using Open, High, Low, Close values)
* Perform exploratory data analysis and data visualization to understand trends
* Scale or normalize data, create time-series input windows for supervised learning
* Train time-series models—common choices include LSTM neural networks or other regression methods
* Generate and visualize predictions versus actual stock prices
* Evaluate model accuracy using relevant metrics

Typical Workflow

To use or explore the project, you’d likely:

1. Clone or download the code
2. Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the main notebook in Jupyter or run the Python script
4. Load your dataset in CSV format—perhaps of a certain stock’s historical data
5. Run through preprocessing steps such as normalization and window generation
6. Train the model (LSTM or similar) and visualize predictions
7. Check how close the predictions are to real historical values and adjust hyperparameters as needed

Why this Matters

Stock price prediction is a classic problem in data science. While financial markets are highly volatile and difficult to forecast with perfect accuracy, time-series models like LSTM can help identify patterns and trends. These models are widely used in algorithmic trading, investment forecasting, and risk modeling, though it’s important to interpret results cautiously.

Potential Future Enhancements

* Fetch live or recent stock data automatically (for example using yfinance or AlphaVantage)
* Add multi-step predictions or explore advanced architectures (such as bidirectional LSTM or GRUs)
* Compare traditional methods—like moving averages or ARIMA—with deep learning approaches
* Build a simple web dashboard (maybe using Streamlit) to input a ticker symbol and visualize predictions
* Optimize performance with hyperparameter tuning, walk-forward validation, or more features like volume, sentiment, or technical indicators

Contributing
